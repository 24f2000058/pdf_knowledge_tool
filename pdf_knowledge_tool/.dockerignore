# Exception: We might want to keep the directory structure, but generally data/ is ignored in context
# if we mount it. However, if we want to copy initial seed data, we might not ignore it.
# Given the user wants persistence via volume, ignoring local data/ in build context is safer
# to avoid overwriting mounted volume or bloating image.
